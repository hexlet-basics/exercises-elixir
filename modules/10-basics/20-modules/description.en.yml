name: Modules
theory: |

  In Elixir, functions are grouped by modules that play the role of namespaces. For example, in the previous exercise we used the function `puts(text)` from module _IO_:

  ```elixir
  IO.puts("Hello, World!")
  ```

  Modules are defined with a special contstruct _defmodule/do/end_:

  ```elixir
  # use CamelCase for name
  defmodule HexletBasics do
    # Here goes module contains
  end
  ```

  Elixir allows the creation of multiple modules in the same file, but there is a convention to have only one module per file with the same name as the module but in _snake_case_.

  Modules can be nested. By convention, we create nested modules when they are located in a directory. For example, there's the module `HexletBasics.Application` located in _lib/hexlet_basics/application.ex_ directory.

  ```elixir
  defmodule HexletBasics.Application do
    # Function
    def hello do
      IO.puts("Hello, World!")
    end
  end
  ```

  Function calls for nested modules are the same as for flat modules. First, we put the module's full name, then a function call.

  ```elixir
  HexletBasics.Application.hello()
  ```

  There is a special module _Kernel_ which functions we can call directly.

  ```elixir
  is_number(13) # true
  ```

  _Kernel_ contains basic language primitives for arithmetic operations, spawning processes, data type handling, macros for defining new functionality, and more.

  Create module _My.Super.Module_ and put the function `hello()` we defined above
